# Sum-Strings-as-Numbers
Regular computer systems cannot store extremely large numbers, hundreds of digits long, hence they are stored in the form of strings, and basic operations may be performed on them.
The cpp file in the repository is my solution to the kata: https://www.codewars.com/kata/5324945e2ece5e1f32000370

The following are taken from the kata details:
DESCRIPTION:
Given the string representations of two integers, return the string representation of the sum of those integers.

For example:
sumStrings('1','2') // => '3'
